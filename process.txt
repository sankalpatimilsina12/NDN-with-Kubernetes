We'll setup an initial kubernetes cluster with just a single node. This node
is the gateway to the cluster and will be the only node that we can access.

This gateway node will run a single NFD which listens for incoming interests.

The incoming interest can have one of two prefixes:

1. /ndn/k8s/data: This is an interest for data fetching from the data lake. Upon receiving the 
interest, the gateway node will route the request to another node in the cluster that is attached
to the data lake.

2. /ndn/k8s/compute: This is an interest for compute request. The interest will first be parsed on the gateway node
to understand the computing requirements. The gateway node will then build a kubernetes node with the specified
requirements and route the interest to the newly created node. The newly created node will then run the compute
job and return the result to the gateway node.
